# What It Does
The program opens notepad, types "Why so serious?" and then closes it. It then copies 100 images of jonkler to your desktop and then changes the wallpaper to jonkler. It will then show a fake bsod screen (you can alt tab out of it and kill the script after).
The script doesn't end on its own, you have to close python or end the task in task manager.
It doesn't actually harm your computer, it just copies some files to the desktop.
